Zigma: Actor-Based Algorithmic Trading Framework

Overview

Zigma is an algorithmic trading framework built with the Zig programming language, leveraging an actor-based concurrency model. This project serves as both a practical trading system and an educational exploration of Zigâ€™s memory management capabilities and concurrency patterns.

Goals \
â€¢ Implement a robust actor framework for handling concurrent trading operations \
â€¢ Explore Zigâ€™s memory management features in depth \
â€¢ Develop efficient, low-latency trading algorithms \
â€¢ Create a modular system that can be extended with new strategies and market connectors  \
â€¢ Serve as a learning resource for Zig programming best practices

Architecture 

Zigma is built around an actor model, where independent components communicate through message passing: \
â€¢ Market Data Actors â€“ Connect to exchanges and process incoming market data \
â€¢ Strategy Actors â€“ Implement trading algorithms and generate signals \
â€¢ Order Management Actors â€“ Handle order creation, modification, and cancellation \
â€¢ Risk Management Actors â€“ Monitor positions and enforce trading limits \
â€¢ Persistence Actors â€“ Handle data storage and retrieval

Features

â€¢ Non-blocking, concurrent processing of market data \
â€¢ Memory-efficient implementation with minimal allocations \
â€¢ Type-safe message passing between actors \
â€¢ Pluggable strategy system for implementing various trading algorithms \
â€¢ Comprehensive logging and monitoring

Learning Outcomes

This project provides hands-on experience with: \
â€¢ Zigâ€™s comptime features and metaprogramming \
â€¢ Manual memory management with allocators \
â€¢ Error handling patterns in Zig \
â€¢ Concurrency without shared state \
â€¢ Performance optimization techniques \
â€¢ Safe interoperability with C libraries

Getting Started
