Zigma: Actor-Based Algorithmic Trading Framework

## Overview

Zigma is an algorithmic trading framework built with the Zig programming language, leveraging an actor-based concurrency model. This project serves as both a practical trading system and an educational exploration of Zig’s memory management capabilities and concurrency patterns.

## Goals
• Implement a robust actor framework for handling concurrent trading operations \
• Explore Zig’s memory management features in depth \
• Develop efficient, low-latency trading algorithms \
• Create a modular system that can be extended with new strategies and market connectors  \
• Serve as a learning resource for Zig programming best practices

## Architecture 

Zigma is built around an actor model, where independent components communicate through message passing: \
• Market Data Actors – Connect to exchanges and process incoming market data \
• Strategy Actors – Implement trading algorithms and generate signals \
• Order Management Actors – Handle order creation, modification, and cancellation \
• Risk Management Actors – Monitor positions and enforce trading limits \
• Persistence Actors – Handle data storage and retrieval

## Features

• Non-blocking, concurrent processing of market data \
• Memory-efficient implementation with minimal allocations \
• Type-safe message passing between actors \
• Pluggable strategy system for implementing various trading algorithms \
• Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Learning Outcomes

This project provides hands-on experience with: \
• Zig’s comptime features and metaprogramming \
• Manual memory management with allocators \
• Error handling patterns in Zig \
• Concurrency without shared state \
• Performance optimization techniques \
• Safe interoperability with C libraries

## Getting Started

(Instructions for building and running the project will be added as development progresses.)
